# Branch protection — MapAble (`main`)

This document is the required configuration for GitHub branch protection on `main`. Apply these settings in the repository’s GitHub settings (Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules). CI cannot enforce protection settings itself; this file is the operational checklist.

**FindingStatus (API read 2026-07-20):**

- `GET /repos/ausdisau/mapableau-new/rulesets` → `[]` (no rulesets visible to the integration token)
- `GET /repos/.../branches/main/protection` → **403** Resource not accessible by integration

Effective branch protection **cannot be claimed configured** from automation. Account owner must verify in GitHub Settings → Rules / Branches.

**Repository ownership (Wave 0):** the repository is owned by personal GitHub user `ausdisau`, not an organisation. Specialist `@ausdisau/team-*` teams cannot exist until the repository is moved under a GitHub Organisation.

## Rules for `main`

1. **No direct push to `main`.** Require pull requests.
2. **No merge without at least one independent approving review.**
3. **Dismiss stale approvals** on new commits.
4. **Require status checks to pass before merging.** Do not allow bypass except break-glass admin with audit (no unrecorded administrator bypass).
5. **Do not allow auto-merge** for remediation or production-impacting PRs.
6. **Require branches to be up to date** before merging when feasible.
7. **Restrict who can push** to matching branches (maintainers only).

## Required status checks

Configure these check names to match the workflow job names exactly:

| Check             | Workflow                                  | Purpose                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CI                | `.github/workflows/ci.yml`                | Install, Prisma, type-check, format, lint, test, build, ownership/migration collision          |
| Migrations        | `.github/workflows/migrations.yml`        | Ephemeral schema coherence + integrity                                                         |
| Migrate from zero | `.github/workflows/migrations.yml`        | Hard-fail `prisma migrate deploy` on empty DB — **green on `main` after #381**; still required |
| Security          | `.github/workflows/security.yml`          | Semgrep + prod audit gate + secret/fallback/route checks                                       |
| Accessibility     | `.github/workflows/accessibility.yml`     | Playwright + axe smoke                                                                         |
| Production claims | `.github/workflows/production-claims.yml` | Public claim / db push / certification language gates                                          |
| Vercel Preview    | Vercel GitHub integration                 | Preview deployment                                                                             |

Until Vercel is connected, mark Vercel Preview as required only when the integration is active (`needs_runtime_verification`).

## CODEOWNERS (immediate vs longer-term)

### Immediate (user-owned repository)

Root `CODEOWNERS` assigns `@ausdisau` for all paths. This is a valid GitHub user owner. It does **not** claim specialist team enforcement.

Specialist second review for auth, consent, safeguarding, billing, payments, tenancy, encryption, and participant-data export remains a **human process**: record the specialist review in the PR until an organisation exists.

### Longer-term (GitHub Organisation)

1. Create a GitHub Organisation and transfer the repository.
2. Create teams:

- `@org/mapable-maintainers` — default
- `@org/mapable-security` — auth, encryption, tenancy
- `@org/mapable-privacy` — consent, participant export
- `@org/mapable-safeguarding` — incidents / Q&S
- `@org/mapable-billing` — billing, payments, payouts

3. Restore team-based CODEOWNERS and enable required CODEOWNER reviews on `main`.

## Specialist second review paths

In addition to one independent reviewer, changes touching these paths require a second specialist approval (human-recorded until teams exist):

- Authentication and sessions (`lib/auth/**`, NextAuth routes)
- Consent (`lib/consent/**`, consent APIs)
- Safeguarding / incidents (`lib/incidents/**`, safety routes)
- Billing and invoices (`lib/billing/**`, `lib/billing-core/**`, `lib/invoices/**`)
- Payments (`lib/stripe/**`, payment/payout APIs)
- Tenancy / organisations (`lib/**/organisation*`, org membership)
- Encryption (`lib/crypto/**`, NDIS encryption)
- Participant-data export / vault paths

## Break-glass

Emergency hotfix to `main` requires:

1. Written reason in the PR
2. Post-merge follow-up issue within 24 hours
3. No silent disabling of required checks without audit note
