# MapAble payments ledger

Internal ledger for Stripe Connect marketplace payouts. MapAble is the **source of business workflow truth**; Stripe is the **payment processing truth**.

## Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Charge / PaymentIntent / Checkout** | Money collected from payer on the MapAble platform account |
| **Transfer** | Money moved from MapAble platform balance to a connected account |
| **Payout** | Money moved from connected account Stripe balance to external bank (Stripe-managed) |
| **Platform fee** | MapAble commission retained on platform balance |
| **Transfer group** | Stripe grouping key tying charge, transfers, and ledger rows to one booking |

Never use "escrow" in product copy without legal approval. Use **payout hold**, **pending service payment**, or **transfer pending confirmation**.
