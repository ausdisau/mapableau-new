# Remediation — Capability Inventory

States used here match the remediation vocabulary
(`concept` | `scaffold` | `demo` | `synthetic_demo` | `internal_alpha` | `controlled_pilot` |
`production_ready` | `generally_available` | `suspended` | `retired`).

ConvergenceOS seeds use a parallel enum (`scaffolded`, `fixture_only`, `shadow`, …) —
see `lib/platform/convergence-os/seed/capabilities.ts` and
[docs/productisation/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY.md](../productisation/CAPABILITY_REGISTRY.md).

**Rule:** Feature flags and documentation are **not** evidence of production readiness.
**Updated:** 2026-07-20 — post #380/#381 on `main` @ `6279ab91`; empty-DB migrate-from-zero green; Wave 1 (#382) still open/off.

## Marketing language vs inventory

| Surface                            | Observation                                                  | Status   |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |

| `/care` hub                        | May lag agreement/handoff APIs — keep coming-soon honest     | likely   |
| Pricing / about pages              | Avoid certification and NDIS registration claims for MapAble | verified |
| Strategy docs                      | Describe intent; never production_ready without registry     | verified |

After capability registry wiring, public availability must come from server maturity evidence,
not hard-coded marketing arrays.
