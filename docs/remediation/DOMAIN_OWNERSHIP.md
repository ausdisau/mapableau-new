## Mutation rule

No other module may directly mutate another domain’s aggregate tables except through its declared service or transaction boundary.

CI ownership check (`scripts/ci/check-domain-ownership.ts`) flags changed files that touch foreign aggregate write paths without going through the owner package (heuristic; expands in later PRs).

## CODEOWNERS mapping

See root `CODEOWNERS`. Specialist second review required for auth, consent, safeguarding, billing, payments, tenancy, encryption, and participant-data export (see `docs/operations/branch-protection.md`).
