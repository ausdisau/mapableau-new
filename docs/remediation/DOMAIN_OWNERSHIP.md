# Remediation — Domain Ownership

**FindingStatus for this file's decisions:** `verified` where grounded in existing code paths; ownership rules below are **declared** for remediation and enforced by `scripts/ci/check-domain-ownership.ts` (PR 1) plus CODEOWNERS.

## Mutation rule

No other module may directly mutate another domain’s aggregate tables except through its declared service or transaction boundary.

CI ownership check (`scripts/ci/check-domain-ownership.ts`) flags changed files that touch foreign aggregate write paths without going through the owner package (heuristic; expands in later PRs).

Cross-domain **read/orchestration** adapters allowlisted in that script (not second SoTs): `lib/matching/`, `lib/ai-matching/`, `lib/ai-platform/`, `lib/mission-portfolio/`, `lib/mission-copilot/`, `lib/case-copilot/`, `lib/programmes/`, plus existing orchestration/booking-graph packages. They must not become care/transport/billing writers. Programme services may store foreign-key references (e.g. `consentRecordId`, `careRequestId`) without owning those aggregates.

## CODEOWNERS mapping

See root `CODEOWNERS`. Specialist second review required for auth, consent, safeguarding, billing, payments, tenancy, encryption, and participant-data export (see `docs/operations/branch-protection.md`).

## Explicit non-owners

| Client-only role UI  | Server authorisation                                                 |
