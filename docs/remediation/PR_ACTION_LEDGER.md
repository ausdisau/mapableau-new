# PR Action Ledger — Leadership train

Source of structured actions: [`lib/convergence-os/seed/pr-action-ledger.ts`](../../lib/convergence-os/seed/pr-action-ledger.ts).

**Inspected main tip (ledger refresh):** `fb80bc83` (includes productisation #327).  
**Full reconciliation:** [LEADERSHIP_TRAIN_RECONCILIATION.md](./LEADERSHIP_TRAIN_RECONCILIATION.md)  
**Rule:** PR descriptions are not evidence that code exists on `main`. Path searches and tests are.  
**Stack policy:** No unmerged stack may grow beyond **3** PRs (`MAX_UNMERGED_STACK_DEPTH`).

## Actions vocabulary

`merge` · `rebase` · `recreate` · `split` · `consolidate` · `supersede` · `close` · `archive` · `defer` · `retain_as_reference` · `retire_after_migration`

## Already on main (retain_as_reference — do not re-merge)

## Immediate close targets (`SUPERSEDED_CLOSE_TARGETS`)

| PR | Reason | Superseded by / next |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #289 | Convergence predecessor | #302 (merged) |
| #290 | Convergence Iteration 2 predecessor | #302 (merged) |
| #291 | VisionAccess standalone | extract later / #308 |
| #264 | Legacy Access Intelligence | AI Next on main |
| #287 | Continuity predecessor | extract from #301 later |
| #288 | Continuity predecessor | extract from #301 later |
| #320 | AccessCast duplicate stack | #324 (merged) |
| #321 | AccessCast Starting Work duplicate | #324 |
| #322 | AccessCast Companion offline duplicate | #324 |
| #325 | AccessCast tip duplicate | #324 |
| #202 | Supabase Auth migration | NextAuth ownership |
| #332 | Transport quotes MIG collision with #328 | recreate `…150000` after #330 |
| #333 | Recurring Care MIG collision with #329 | recreate `…160000` after quotes |
| #334 | Starting Work duplicate of #330 | #330 |
| #335 | Premature Continuity tip / stack >3 | Prompt 3 after Care/Transport |

## Immediate leadership train (depth ≤ 3)

| Order | PR | Action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | #331 | **merge** | Strategy / operating lanes — no product migration |
| 2 | #328 | **rebase** → merge | Trust Fabric; keep `20260717120000` |
| 3 | #329 | **rebase** → merge | Access Evidence; keep `20260717130000` |

Then **rebase** #330 onto main (Starting Work DB). Recreate Transport quotes / Recurring Care with unique migrations only after #330.

## Do not merge unchanged

| PRs | Action |
| --- | --- |
| #301, #309 | **defer** — extract-only mega-branches |
| #319 | **defer** — Replay Lab after domain slices |
| #280, #273, #265, #308, #283 | **supersede** / extract later |
| #292–#299, #311, #318 | **defer** NDIS/AURA/governance megas |
| #231–#255 CareOS | **archive** / **defer** — no second Care writer |

## Refresh

Re-run `gh pr list` and update the TypeScript ledger when topology changes. Keep `SUPERSEDED_CLOSE_TARGETS` in sync with close actions. Run `pnpm exec tsx scripts/ci/check-merge-train-integrity.ts`.
