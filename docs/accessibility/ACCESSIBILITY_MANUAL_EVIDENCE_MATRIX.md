# Accessibility manual evidence matrix

**Do not claim WCAG conformance.**  
Automated Playwright/axe coverage is necessary but not sufficient.  
**Status:** all manual rows `NOT_RUN` until a human tester records evidence.

## Automated coverage (repository)

| Check | Evidence | Status |
| ----- | -------- | ------ |
| Playwright + axe smoke | Accessibility workflow | `VERIFIED` on `main` post-#380; #382 tip `FAILED` (build OOM) |
| Authenticated pilot routes | Seeded storage-state; `A11Y_SKIP_AUTH_ROUTES=0` in workflow | Must not be silently skipped |

## Manual matrix

| ID | Method | Tester | Device | Browser | Date | Journey | Result | Defect IDs | Evidence link | Status |
| -- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ---- | ------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------- | ------ |
| M1 | Keyboard-only | | | | | G1–G9 | | | | `NOT_RUN` |
| M2 | NVDA + Chrome | | | | | G1–G9 | | | | `NOT_RUN` |
| M3 | NVDA + Firefox | | | | | G1–G9 | | | | `NOT_RUN` |
| M4 | VoiceOver + Safari | | | | | G1–G9 | | | | `NOT_RUN` |
| M5 | TalkBack + Chrome | | | | | G1–G9 | | | | `NOT_RUN` |
| M6 | 200% zoom / reflow | | | | | G1–G9 | | | | `NOT_RUN` |
| M7 | 400% zoom / reflow | | | | | G1–G9 | | | | `NOT_RUN` |
| M8 | Windows High Contrast | | | | | G1–G9 | | | | `NOT_RUN` |
| M9 | Prefers reduced motion | | | | | G1–G9 | | | | `NOT_RUN` |
| M10 | Screen magnification | | | | | G1–G9 | | | | `NOT_RUN` |
| M11 | Switch / voice navigation consideration | | | | | G1–G9 | | | | `NOT_RUN` |
| M12 | Cognitive clarity / plain-language errors | | | | | G1–G9 | | | | `NOT_RUN` |

## Release rule

Serious or critical failures on protected pilot journeys are **release blockers**. Do not mark manual checks passed without human evidence.
