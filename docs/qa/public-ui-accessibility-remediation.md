# Public UI accessibility remediation — manual test checklist

Automated axe/Playwright coverage supports regression detection. **It does not constitute WCAG 2.2 AA conformance.** Manual testing (including disabled participants) remains required before any conformance claim.

Do not mark items passed unless they were actually performed in this environment.

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Keyboard-only walkthrough (skip → nav → hero → filters → place card → map) | Not run | |
| NVDA with Firefox or Chrome | Not run | |
| VoiceOver with Safari | Not run | |
| 200% browser zoom | Not run | |
| 400% browser zoom / reflow | Not run | |
| Windows High Contrast / forced colours | Not run | |
| Reduced motion (`prefers-reduced-motion`) | Not run | |
| Mobile screen reader (TalkBack / VoiceOver iOS) | Not run | |
| Switch-control style sequential navigation | Not run | |
| Voice-control visible-label matching | Not run | |
| Map list alternative (results without coordinates) | Not run | |
| Cognitive load / plain-language review | Not run | |
| Participant testing with compensated disabled users | Not run | |

## MapAble Accessibility Panel

| Check | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Panel opens from header/footer triggers (not a floating map overlay) | Automated | `tests/a11y/accessibility-panel.spec.ts` |
| Escape / close restore focus to trigger | Automated | |
| Presets + individual controls + reset | Automated | unit + component + Playwright |
| Local storage private by default; no analytics of preference values | Code review | storage key `mapable:accessibility-ui:v1` |
| Optional account sync does not overwrite mobility/sensory/share fields | Automated | `tests/accessibility/digital-preferences-api.test.ts` |
| Panel with every contrast theme / 200% text / 320px reflow | Automated | axe-assisted; not a conformance claim |
| Keyboard + screen-reader walkthrough with each preset | Not run | Manual AT testing still required |
| Forced colours with panel open/closed | Not run | |
| Maps remain usable with large cursor / text scale | Not run | |

Panel behaviour to communicate to users:

- Personalises presentation only; core accessibility is always on.
- Does not guarantee WCAG conformance.
- OS/browser preferences remain respected.
- Reset clears local settings; account sync is opt-in and revocable.

## Known limitations and unresolved risks

- No third-party accessibility overlay is used; first-party semantics, focus and the MapAble Accessibility Panel are the remediation path.
- AccessiBe removal means previous overlay-dependent users lose that widget — communicate via accessibility statement / feedback and point them to Accessibility settings.
- Leaflet map markers remain a hybrid DOM/canvas interaction model; list view is the guaranteed alternative.
- Authenticated dashboard shells are skipped in CI without seeded storage state (`A11Y_SKIP_AUTH_ROUTES=1`).
- Social profile icons render only when verified `NEXT_PUBLIC_*_URL` env vars are set.
- NDIS registration wording remains “To be confirmed” until organisation registration is verified — do not invent a number.
- Formal WCAG audit and participant testing are still outstanding.

## Brand asset follow-up

A reviewed horizontal logo asset is preferred for marketing headers. Current committed artwork is retained with accessible naming and fixed dimensions to avoid layout shift.
