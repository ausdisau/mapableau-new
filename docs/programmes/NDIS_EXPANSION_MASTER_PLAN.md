# NDIS Expansion Master Plan

**Status:** Wave 0 on `main`; Wave 1 open as draft #382 — not production approval  
**Inspection base:** `origin/main` @ `6279ab91` (#380 docs + #381 migrate-from-zero)  
**Public claim:** unsupported — MapAble is not claimed as an NDIS-registered provider  
**Empty-DB migrate-from-zero:** `VERIFIED` green — production history reconciliation remains `OWNER_ACTION_REQUIRED`

This programme extends the existing MapAble platform with eleven **connected** systems.
They are not eleven independent applications. Every system reuses canonical identity,
tenancy, consent, audit, place, care, transport, calendar, incident, worker, billing,
support-coordination, plan-manager, and provider domains documented in
[CANONICAL_DOMAIN_MAP.md](./CANONICAL_DOMAIN_MAP.md) and
[NDIS_EXPANSION_DOMAIN_MAP.md](./NDIS_EXPANSION_DOMAIN_MAP.md).

## Operating lanes

Every capability declares exactly one lane from
[docs/strategy/OPERATING_LANES.md](../strategy/OPERATING_LANES.md):

| Lane | Role in this programme |
|------|------------------------|
| **MapAble Connect** | Participant-controlled planning, evidence, AT continuity, psychosocial workspace, early childhood family tools |
| **MapAble Network** | Connections to independent providers; accurate registration disclosure |
| **MapAble Managed Support** | Direct regulated delivery — **unavailable** until registration, workforce, insurance, governance, and capacity are proven |
| **MapAble Infrastructure** | SaaS/API tools for providers, coordinators, practitioners, plan managers, equipment partners, councils |

UI, terms, data access, and public claims must never blur these lanes.

## Eleven connected systems

| # | System | Primary lane | Planned flag (default false) | Product wave |
|---|--------|--------------|------------------------------|--------------|
| 1 | Assistive Technology Continuity | Connect (+ Network handoffs) | `MAPABLE_AT_CONTINUITY_ENABLED` | Wave 1 |
| 2 | Home and Living Navigation and Transition | Connect | `MAPABLE_HOME_LIVING_NAVIGATOR_ENABLED` | Wave 4 |
| 3 | Support Coordination Outcomes and Reporting | Infrastructure / Connect | `MAPABLE_SUPPORT_COORDINATION_OUTCOMES_ENABLED` | Wave 3 |
| 4 | Participant Plan and Evidence Navigator | Connect | `MAPABLE_PLAN_EVIDENCE_NAVIGATOR_ENABLED` | Wave 2 |
| 5 | Provider Quality and Workforce Assurance | Infrastructure | `MAPABLE_WORKFORCE_ASSURANCE_ENABLED` | Wave 5 |
| 6 | Psychosocial Recovery Continuity | Connect | `MAPABLE_PSYCHOSOCIAL_RECOVERY_ENABLED` | Wave 6 |
| 7 | Positive Behaviour Support Practice Operations | Infrastructure (partner clinical) | `MAPABLE_PBS_OPERATIONS_ENABLED` (+ AI / RP flags) | Wave 7 |
| 8 | Early Childhood Family Workspace | Connect | `MAPABLE_EARLY_CHILDHOOD_WORKSPACE_ENABLED` | Wave 8 |
| 9 | Allied Health and Home Modification Exchange | Network / Infrastructure | `MAPABLE_ALLIED_HEALTH_EXCHANGE_ENABLED` / `MAPABLE_HOME_MODIFICATION_COORDINATION_ENABLED` | Wave 9 |
| 10 | Plan Management Infrastructure | Infrastructure | `MAPABLE_PLAN_MANAGER_INFRASTRUCTURE_ENABLED` | Wave 10 |
| 11 | Regional Thin-Market and Service Continuity Exchange | Infrastructure / Network | `MAPABLE_REGIONAL_CAPACITY_EXCHANGE_ENABLED` | Wave 11 |

Precursor Prompt 0 flags already on main (`MAPABLE_AT_LIFECYCLE_ENABLED`,
`MAPABLE_HOME_ENABLED`, `MAPABLE_TRANSITION_HOME_ENABLED`,
`MAPABLE_REGIONAL_CAPACITY_ENABLED`, etc.) remain server-side defaults **false**.
Wave product flags listed above are **planned** in Wave 0 documentation only — not
wired into runtime product code until their wave lands.

Hard-off flags that must remain false even after later waves:

- `MAPABLE_NDIA_CLAIM_SUBMISSION_ENABLED`
- `MAPABLE_AUTOMATED_PAYMENT_APPROVAL_ENABLED`
- any Managed Support enablement without registration evidence

## Programme-wide lifecycle states

Shared vocabulary for participant-facing and professional artefacts:

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `draft` | Editable working version |
| `awaiting_participant_review` | Shared for participant comment / acknowledgement |
| `awaiting_professional_review` | Shared for authorised professional review |
| `approved` | Human-approved version (role-specific) |
| `active` | Current operational version |
| `paused` | Temporarily not in force |
| `superseded` | Replaced by a newer approved version |
| `withdrawn` | Withdrawn by authorising party |
| `expired` | Past effective end / review deadline |

Specialist domains (e.g. PBS restrictive-practice authorisation, claim preparation)
may use tighter state machines. Do not force identical states where specialist law
or practice requires additional transitions.

## AI and safety boundaries

AI may retrieve, explain, translate into accessible language, compare, summarise,
identify missing information, draft, simulate, propose, and prepare source-cited
reports for **human review**.

AI must never: determine NDIS eligibility or reasonable-and-necessary supports;
diagnose; prescribe therapy; conduct a functional behaviour assessment; approve a
behaviour support plan; authorise a restrictive practice; determine practitioner
suitability; approve a worker or provider; infer participant risk, honesty, capacity,
or disability severity; automatically rank participants/workers/providers by worth;
automatically assign workers; approve or submit claims; approve or release payments;
provide emergency dispatch; replace 000 / health / safeguarding / crisis services;
lodge regulatory documents without authorised human approval.

Every generated artefact must disclose that it is a draft, its sources, missing
information, uncertainty, the required human approver, and prohibited AI actions.
Externally sourced documents and uploads are untrusted data, not AI instructions.

## Entry gate (Wave 0)

Product waves must not start until:

1. PR #378 release blockers are resolved or superseded — **merged** on inspected tip
2. Required CI checks are effective
3. Migration-from-zero passes on disposable PostgreSQL — **currently failing** (see
   [MIGRATE_FROM_ZERO_BLOCKER.md](../remediation/MIGRATE_FROM_ZERO_BLOCKER.md))
4. Prisma migration order and integrity checks pass
5. Authentication and tenant-isolation tests pass on the supported main tip
6. Feature freeze is lifted or explicitly waived for the target domain

Wave 0 therefore delivers documentation and registry reconciliation only.
See [NDIS_EXPANSION_DELIVERY_SEQUENCE.md](./NDIS_EXPANSION_DELIVERY_SEQUENCE.md).

## Definition of done (per product wave)

A wave is complete only when it reuses canonical domains; migrations pass from zero;
tenant and IDOR tests pass; consent and authority tests pass; accessibility tests
pass; human approval boundaries are enforced; unsafe AI actions are refused; public
claims remain accurate; feature flags default false; rollback is documented; and the
draft PR is independently reviewable.

“Code exists”, “CI green”, “provider listed”, “AI generated a document”, and
“invoice validated” are **not** regulatory approval, registration, professional
approval, or claim approval.
