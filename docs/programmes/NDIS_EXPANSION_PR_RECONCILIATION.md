# NDIS Expansion — PR Reconciliation

**Inspection date:** 2026-07-20 (truth/controls refresh)  
**Base tip:** `origin/main` @ `6279ab9198df2ebefb15a1ec5fe22ac735d21aa1`  
**Rule:** A PR merged into another unmerged feature branch is **not** available on `main`.

## Classification vocabulary

| Class | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| already on main | Merge commit is an ancestor of current `main` |
| reusable | Tip contains extractable patterns; not landed as SoT |
| overlapping | Touches the same product surface as an expansion wave |
| superseded | Replaced by a later tip or by landed main work |
| unsafe | Would violate lane, AI, migration, or claim discipline if merged as-is |
| feature-branch-only | Merged into a feature branch that is not on `main` |
| requires extraction | Useful code must be rebased/extracted onto current `main` |
| requires closure | Human should close or supersede to reduce backlog noise |
| external blocker | Blocked by account-owner, registration, partner, or migration evidence |

## Named PRs (current)

| PR | State | Base → Head | Classification | Expansion relevance |
|----|-------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **#381** | **MERGED** | `main` ← migration trust repair | **already on main** | Empty-DB migrate-from-zero green |
| **#380** | **MERGED** | `main` ← NDIS Expansion Wave 0 | **already on main** | Docs/registry only |
| **#378** | **MERGED** | `main` ← Wave 0 repair | **already on main** | Controlled-pilot remediation |
| **#382** | OPEN draft | `main` ← AT Continuity Wave 1 | **overlapping** · CI `FAILED` | Wave 1 product; flag off; repair in place |
| **#379** | OPEN draft | `main` ← PBS foundation | **overlapping** · **unsafe** as Wave 7 SoT · CONFLICTING | Uses `lib/positive-behaviour-support/**`; canonical planned owner is `lib/pbs-operations/**` — designate **blocked / extractable future Wave 7** |
| **#383** | OPEN draft | `main` ← VisionAccess contracts | freeze review | Not an NDIS Expansion wave; keep flags false |
| **#367/#384/#385/#386** | OPEN draft stack | Geoscape train depth **4** | **unsafe** stack policy | Not NDIS Expansion; human must reduce depth ≤3 |
| **#188** | OPEN | Support Coordination UI | **overlapping** · **requires extraction** | Wave 3 |
| **#189** | OPEN draft | AbilityPay | **overlapping** · **requires extraction** | Wave 10 precursor |
| **#286** | OPEN draft | NDIS Gateway canonical | **overlapping** · **reusable** | Not landed SoT |
| **#294** | OPEN draft | Q&S Ops | **overlapping** · **requires extraction** | Wave 5 adjacent |

## Platform and migration blockers

| Item | Classification | Evidence / action |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| Migrate-from-zero empty DB | **already remediated on main** | #381; CI `Migrate from zero` green — see [MIGRATE_FROM_ZERO_REPAIR.md](../remediation/MIGRATE_FROM_ZERO_REPAIR.md) |
| Production migration checksum / rename drift | **external blocker** | `OWNER_ACTION_REQUIRED` — staging rehearsal + owner SQL only |
| Feature freeze | **programme control** | Active; AT Continuity narrow waiver for #382 only |
| Live NDIA claim submission | **external blocker** | Formal authorisation absent; flags must stay false |
| Automated payment approval | **external blocker** / permanent prohibition for AI | Must stay false |
| MapAble Managed Support | **external blocker** | Registration/workforce/insurance not proven |
| Branch protection independent review | **external blocker** | `OWNER_ACTION_REQUIRED` |

## Recommended human actions (non-executing)

This document does **not** close, merge, or rebase foreign PRs.

| Target | Suggested ledger action |
|--------|-------------------------|
| #382 | Repair format + a11y OOM on existing branch; leave draft until green + human acceptance |
| #379 | `close` or `recreate` later onto `lib/pbs-operations/**` for Wave 7 — do not merge as-is |
| #367→#386 | Reduce stack to ≤3 via merge/retarget/consolidate (human) |
| #188, #189, #294 | `rebase`/`extract` when wave prerequisites clear |
| Production checksums | Owner runbook only |

## Stack discipline

- Maximum **three** stacked unmerged PRs
- Prefer each wave from latest merged `main`
- Do not open Wave *n+3* while Wave *n* is unmerged
- Avoid stacking product migrations wherever possible
