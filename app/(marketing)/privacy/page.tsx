              Public website use may involve basic technical information such as
              browser, device and page interaction data. During pilot
              onboarding, MapAble may ask for profile, access-needs, provider or
              contact information. NDIS plan documents are optional and should
              only be shared through consent-controlled workflows when needed.

              Disability, health, clinical, support and NDIS information is

              inside identity-provider metadata and is only accessible through
              role and consent checks.

              MapAble is planned around reasonable technical and organisational
              controls, including role-aware access, consent records, audit
              logs, data access logs and restricted document handling. Hosting,
              backups, logs and subprocessors remain under review before any
              data sovereignty claim is made.
