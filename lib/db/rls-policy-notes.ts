/**
 * MapAble uses Prisma against PostgreSQL. When hosted on Supabase, Prisma still
 * enforces access through application services unless explicit RLS policies are added.
 * All sensitive access MUST be enforced in application services:
 * - lib/auth/guards.ts and lib/auth/permissions.ts (RBAC)
 * - ConsentRecord checks (e.g. lib/support-coordinator/consent-gate.ts)
 * - lib/messages/message-access-policy.ts (thread participants)
 * - Document access via lib/storage/document-storage-service.ts
 *
 * If migrating to Supabase RLS, mirror these policies in SQL and keep server-side checks.
