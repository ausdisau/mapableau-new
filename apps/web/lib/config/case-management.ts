/**
 * Feature flags for the AI-Enabled Case Management module.
 *
 * - `enabled` gates the module entirely. When false the API returns 404 and
 *   the dashboard renders a disabled-state page.
 * - `aiEnabled` controls whether the AI insight endpoints will run. The
 *   default engine is rule-based and offline; turning this off is useful
 *   if regulators require all AI off in a deployment.
 * - `aiAutoRunOnCreate` makes case creation trigger a baseline summary
 *   insight. The engine remains advisory; humans must acknowledge insights
 *   before they influence escalation.
